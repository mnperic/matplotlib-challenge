\
1. There is a positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the size of the tumour. This linear correlation is indicated by the P-Value of 0.84. Therefore, it may be effective to limit the weight of the mice.\
\
2. Of the four drug regimens, Capomulin seems to be the most effective drug to treat the cancer. For example, the tumour size in Mouse I509 decreased over time.\
\
3. Of the four drug regimens analysed, Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective at decreasing tumour size. Conversely, Infubinol and Ceftamin were less effective in treating the cancers. Consequently, I would recommend further studies or advancing the stages of both Capomulin and Ramicane in the treatment of tumours.}
